# Git Cheatsheet

Git is a version control system used for tracking changes in code and collaborating with others on software projects. Here is an overview of its features, commands, and resources.

## Features

- Git allows developers to track changes in code over time.
- It is a distributed version control system, meaning that each developer has a complete copy of the codebase.
- Git supports branching and merging, allowing developers to work on different features or versions of the codebase simultaneously.
- Git provides tools for collaborating with other developers, including pull requests and code reviews.

## Commands

### Basic Commands

- `git init`: initialize a new Git repository
- `git clone`: clone an existing Git repository
- `git add`: stage changes for commit
- `git commit`: commit changes to the repository
- `git push`: push changes to a remote repository
- `git pull`: pull changes from a remote repository

### Branching Commands

- `git branch`: list, create, or delete branches
- `git checkout`: switch to a different branch or commit
- `git merge`: merge changes from one branch into another

### Collaboration Commands

- `git fetch`: download changes from a remote repository
- `git pull-request`: create a pull request to merge changes into a branch
- `git review`: review a pull request
