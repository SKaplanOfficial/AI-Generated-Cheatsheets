# Prompt Engineering Cheatsheet

Prompt engineering is the process of designing effective prompts for AIs.

## Principles of Effective Prompts

- **Clarity:** Prompts should be clear and concise, with unambiguous language and a defined scope.
- **Completeness:** Prompts should provide all necessary information to generate a desired response.
- **Relevance:** Prompts should be relevant to the task at hand and avoid unnecessary information.
- **Consistency:** Prompts should be consistent in their structure, language, and formatting.
- **Simplicity:** Prompts should be simple and easy to understand, avoiding complex syntax or overly technical terms.

## Types of Prompts

- **Open-ended:** Prompts that allow for a wide range of responses, often used for creative tasks or generating diverse outputs.
- **Closed-ended:** Prompts that require specific types of responses, often used for more structured or quantitative tasks.
- **Directed:** Prompts that provide specific guidance or constraints on the response.
- **Undirected:** Prompts that provide no specific guidance or constraints on the response.

## Best Practices

- **Test and refine:** Test prompts with multiple AIs and refine based on performance and feedback.
- **Include examples:** Provide examples of desired responses to clarify the prompt.
- **Collaborate:** Work with domain experts to ensure prompts are relevant and accurate.
- **Balance complexity:** Avoid overly complex prompts that may be difficult for AIs to understand.
- **Monitor performance:** Continuously monitor AI performance and adjust prompts as necessary.
