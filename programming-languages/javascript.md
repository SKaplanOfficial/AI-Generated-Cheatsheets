# JavaScript Cheatsheet

JavaScript is a high-level programming language used primarily for developing web applications. Here is an overview of its features, code blocks, and resources.

## Features

- JavaScript is a scripting language that can be used to add interactivity to web pages.
- It can be used for both front-end and back-end development.
- JavaScript is dynamically typed, which means that variables do not need to be declared before use.
- JavaScript supports functional programming paradigms as well as object-oriented programming.

## Code Blocks

### Variables

Variables are used to store data that can be used later in the program.

```javascript
let variableName = value;
```

### Functions

Functions are code blocks that perform a specific task. They can be called by other parts of the program.

```javascript
function functionName(parameter1, parameter2) {
  // code to be executed
}
```

### Conditionals

Conditionals allow the program to make decisions based on certain conditions.

```javascript
if (condition) {
  // code to be executed if condition is true
} else if (otherCondition) {
  // code to be executed if otherCondition is true
} else {
  // code to be executed if neither condition is true
}
```

### Loops

Loops allow the program to repeat a set of instructions.

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  // code to be executed
}
```

### Objects

Objects are a fundamental part of JavaScript and are used to store and manipulate data.

```javascript
const objectName = {
  property1: value1,
  property2: value2,
  method: function() {
    // code to be executed
  }
};
```
