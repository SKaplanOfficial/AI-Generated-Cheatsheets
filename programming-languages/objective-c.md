# Objective-C Cheatsheet

Objective-C is a programming language used primarily for developing applications for Apple's Mac OS X and iOS operating systems. Here is an overview of its features, code blocks, and resources.

## Features

- Objective-C is an object-oriented programming language.
- It is a superset of the C programming language, meaning that it includes all of the features of C as well as additional features for object-oriented programming.
- Objective-C uses a dynamic runtime system, which allows for features such as late binding and dynamic method resolution.
- Objective-C is the primary programming language used for developing applications for Apple's Mac OS X and iOS operating systems.

## Code Blocks

### Variables

Variables are used to store data that can be used later in the program.

```objective-c
int variableName = value;
```

### Methods

Methods are code blocks that perform a specific task. They can be called by other parts of the program.

```objective-c
-  (void)methodName:(parameterType)parameterName {
    // code to be executed
}
```

### Conditionals

Conditionals allow the program to make decisions based on certain conditions.

```objective-c
if (condition) {
    // code to be executed if condition is true
} else if (otherCondition) {
    // code to be executed if otherCondition is true
} else {
    // code to be executed if neither condition is true
}
```

### Loops

Loops allow the program to repeat a set of instructions.

```objective-c
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    // code to be executed
}
```

### Objects

Objective-C is an object-oriented programming language, and objects are a fundamental part of the language.

```objective-c
@interface ClassName : SuperclassName
// properties and methods
@end

@implementation ClassName
// implementation of methods
@end
```
