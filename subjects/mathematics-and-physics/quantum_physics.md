# Quantum Physics Cheatsheet

## Basic Concepts
- Quantum physics is the study of the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic level.
- Quantum mechanics is the mathematical framework used to describe quantum phenomena.
- Quantum mechanics is based on the principles of superposition and entanglement.

## Wave-Particle Duality
- The wave-particle duality is the concept that particles can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior.
- The de Broglie wavelength is the wavelength associated with a particle, given by λ = h/p, where h is Planck's constant and p is the particle's momentum.

## Uncertainty Principle
- The uncertainty principle states that the more precisely the position of a particle is known, the less precisely its momentum can be known, and vice versa.
- The uncertainty principle is a fundamental limit on the precision of measurements in quantum mechanics.

## Superposition
- Superposition is the principle that a quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously.
- The Schrödinger equation is the equation that describes the time evolution of a quantum system.

## Entanglement
- Entanglement is the phenomenon where two or more particles can become correlated in such a way that the state of one particle is dependent on the state of the other(s).
- Entanglement is a key feature of quantum computing and quantum communication.

## Quantum Computing
- Quantum computing is the use of quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform computation.
- Quantum computers are expected to be able to solve certain problems much faster than classical computers.
- The most well-known quantum algorithm is Shor's algorithm, which can factor large numbers exponentially faster than classical algorithms.
