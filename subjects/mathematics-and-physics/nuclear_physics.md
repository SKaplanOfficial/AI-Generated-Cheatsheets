# Nuclear Physics Cheatsheet

## Basic Concepts
- Nuclear physics is the study of the properties and behavior of atomic nuclei.
- Nuclear physics is an interdisciplinary field that combines physics, chemistry, and engineering.
- Applications of nuclear physics include nuclear power, nuclear medicine, and nuclear weapons.

## Atomic Nuclei
- Atomic nuclei are composed of protons and neutrons, collectively known as nucleons.
- The number of protons in a nucleus determines the element, while the number of neutrons determines the isotope.
- The strong nuclear force is the force that binds nucleons together in a nucleus.

## Nuclear Reactions
- Nuclear reactions involve changes to the composition of atomic nuclei.
- Nuclear reactions can be induced by bombarding nuclei with particles or photons.
- Nuclear reactions can release or absorb energy, depending on the reactants and products.

## Radioactivity
- Radioactivity is the spontaneous emission of particles or photons from atomic nuclei.
- Radioactivity can be alpha decay, beta decay, or gamma decay, depending on the type of particle or photon emitted.
- The half-life is the time it takes for half of a sample of a radioactive substance to decay.

## Nuclear Energy
- Nuclear energy is the energy released by nuclear reactions.
- Nuclear power plants use nuclear reactions to generate electricity.
- Nuclear weapons use nuclear reactions to release large amounts of energy in a short time.

## Nuclear Medicine
- Nuclear medicine is the use of radioactive substances in the diagnosis and treatment of disease.
- Positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are imaging techniques that use radioactive tracers.
- Radiation therapy uses high-energy radiation to treat cancer.

## Nuclear Astrophysics
- Nuclear astrophysics is the study of the nuclear reactions that power stars and other celestial objects.
- Stellar nucleosynthesis is the process by which elements are formed in stars.
- Supernova explosions can release large amounts of energy and create heavy elements.
