# Physics Cheatsheet

## Basic Concepts

- **Scalars:** Physical quantities with only magnitude (e.g., mass, time, temperature)
- **Vectors:** Physical quantities with both magnitude and direction (e.g., velocity, force, displacement)
- **Kinematics:** The study of motion without considering its causes (e.g., position, velocity, acceleration)
- **Dynamics:** The study of the causes of motion (e.g., forces, energy, momentum)
- **Work:** The product of force and displacement in the direction of the force
- **Energy:** The ability to do work
- **Power:** The rate at which work is done

## Laws and Principles

- **Newton's Laws of Motion:**
    1. An object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force.
    2. The rate of change of momentum of an object is directly proportional to the force applied, and takes place in the direction in which the force is applied.
    3. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
- **Law of Conservation of Energy:** Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or converted from one form to another.
- **Law of Conservation of Momentum:** In the absence of external forces, the total momentum of a system remains constant.
- **Second Law of Thermodynamics:** In any natural process, the total entropy of a closed system always increases over time.

## Equations

- **Kinematics:**
    - Average velocity: v = Δx / Δt
    - Average acceleration: a = Δv / Δt
    - Final velocity: vf = vi + at
    - Displacement: Δx = vavg * t
    - Final velocity squared: vf^2 = vi^2 + 2aΔx
- **Dynamics:**
    - Force: F = ma
    - Weight: w = mg
    - Work: W = Fd cos(θ)
    - Kinetic energy: K = (1/2)mv^2
    - Potential energy: U = mgh
    - Power: P = W / t
- **Thermodynamics:**
    - First Law: ΔU = Q - W
    - Efficiency: η = W / Qh
