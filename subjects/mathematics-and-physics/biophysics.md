# Biophysics Cheatsheet

## Basic Concepts
- Biophysics is the study of the physical principles that govern biological systems.
- Biophysics is an interdisciplinary field that combines physics, biology, and chemistry.
- Biophysics research can involve the study of molecules, cells, tissues, and organisms.

## Biomolecules
- Biomolecules are molecules that are essential to life, including proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids.
- The structure and function of biomolecules can be studied using techniques such as X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.
- Computational methods, such as molecular dynamics simulations, can be used to study the behavior of biomolecules.

## Cellular Biophysics
- Cellular biophysics is the study of the physical properties of cells, including their shape, mechanics, and electrical properties.
- Techniques such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) and micropipette aspiration can be used to measure the mechanical properties of cells.
- Patch clamp electrophysiology can be used to measure the electrical properties of cells.

## Biomechanics
- Biomechanics is the study of the mechanical properties of biological systems, including bones, muscles, and tissues.
- Biomechanics research can involve the study of movement, injury, and disease.
- Biomechanical models can be used to simulate the behavior of biological systems.

## Medical Physics
- Medical physics is the application of physics to medicine, including the use of radiation in diagnosis and treatment.
- Medical physics research can involve the development of imaging techniques, such as X-ray, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
- Radiation therapy is a common medical application of physics, where high-energy radiation is used to treat cancer.

## Neuroscience
- Neuroscience is the study of the nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and nerves.
- Neurobiophysics is a subfield of biophysics that focuses on the physical principles that govern the behavior of neurons and neural networks.
- Techniques such as electrophysiology and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can be used to study the activity of the brain.
