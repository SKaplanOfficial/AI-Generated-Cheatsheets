# Combinatorics Cheatsheet

## Basic Concepts
- Combinatorics is the study of counting and arranging objects.
- Combinatorial problems often involve selecting objects from a set, arranging objects in a sequence, or constructing objects subject to certain conditions.

## Permutations
- A permutation is an arrangement of objects in a specific order.
- The number of permutations of n objects is n!, i.e., the product of all positive integers up to n.

## Combinations
- A combination is a selection of objects from a set without regard to order.
- The number of combinations of k objects from a set of n objects is denoted by n choose k, written as nCk or C(n,k), and is given by the formula n! / (k!(n-k)!).

## Pigeonhole Principle
- The pigeonhole principle states that if k + 1 or more objects are placed into k boxes, then there must be at least one box containing two or more objects.

## Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
- The inclusion-exclusion principle is a counting technique used to calculate the size of a union of sets.
- For two sets A and B, the principle states that |A union B| = |A| + |B| - |A intersect B|.
- The principle can be extended to more than two sets.

## Generating Functions
- A generating function is a formal power series used to encode information about a sequence of numbers.
- The coefficients of the generating function can be used to determine the number of ways to count or arrange objects.
- Generating functions can be manipulated using algebraic operations such as addition, multiplication, and composition.

## Recurrence Relations
- A recurrence relation is an equation that recursively defines a sequence of numbers.
- Recurrence relations can be used to model combinatorial problems, such as counting the number of ways to arrange objects subject to certain conditions.
- Techniques such as substitution and generating functions can be used to solve recurrence relations.
