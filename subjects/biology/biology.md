## Cell Biology

### Organelles

| Organelle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Nucleus | Contains genetic material (DNA) |
| Mitochondria | Site of cellular respiration |
| Ribosomes | Site of protein synthesis |
| Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) | Network of membranes for protein folding and transport |
| Golgi apparatus | Modifies, sorts, and packages proteins and lipids |
| Lysosome | Contains enzymes for breaking down cellular waste |

### Cell Cycle

1. G1 (gap 1) phase: Growth and normal cell functions
2. S phase: DNA replication
3. G2 (gap 2) phase: Growth and preparation for cell division
4. M (mitotic) phase: Cell division (mitosis and cytokinesis)

## Genetics

### Mendelian Genetics

- Law of segregation: Each individual has two alleles for each gene, and they segregate (separate) during gamete formation
- Law of independent assortment: Genes on different chromosomes assort independently during gamete formation
- Dominant alleles are expressed over recessive alleles

### DNA Structure

- DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is composed of nucleotides
- Nucleotides consist of a sugar molecule (deoxyribose), a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base (adenine, thymine, cytosine, or guanine)
- DNA is double-stranded and complementary (A-T, C-G)

### DNA Replication

1. Helicase unwinds and separates the DNA strands.
2. Primase adds RNA primers to the template strand.
3. DNA polymerase synthesizes a new strand of DNA in the 5' to 3' direction.
4. DNA ligase seals the gaps between Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand.

## Ecology

### Levels of Organization

1. Organism: An individual living thing
2. Population: A group of individuals of the same species in a particular area
3. Community: All the different species in a particular area
4. Ecosystem: The community and the abiotic factors (non-living components) in a particular area
5. Biome: A group of similar ecosystems with the same climate and dominant vegetation
6. Biosphere: The sum of all the biomes on Earth

### Symbiosis

- Mutualism: Both organisms benefit from the interaction
- Commensalism: One organism benefits, and the other is not affected
- Parasitism: One organism benefits, and the other is harmed

### Succession

- Primary succession: Succession on newly exposed surfaces that have no soil
- Secondary succession: Succession that occurs after a disturbance (e.g., fire, flood) has removed some or all of the previous organisms
