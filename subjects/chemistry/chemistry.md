# CHEMISTRY CHEATSHEET

## Basic Concepts

- **Atom**: the basic unit of matter, consisting of a nucleus (protons and neutrons) surrounded by electrons.
- **Molecule**: a group of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds.
- **Element**: a substance composed of only one type of atom.
- **Compound**: a substance composed of two or more elements chemically combined in a fixed ratio.
- **Ion**: an atom or molecule with a net electric charge due to the loss or gain of one or more electrons.

## Chemical Bonds

- **Ionic Bond**: a bond formed by the transfer of electrons between atoms.
- **Covalent Bond**: a bond formed by the sharing of electrons between atoms.
- **Hydrogen Bond**: a weak bond between two molecules resulting from an electrostatic attraction between a proton in one molecule and an electronegative atom in the other.

## Chemical Reactions

- **Reactant**: a substance that takes part in and undergoes change in a chemical reaction.
- **Product**: a substance produced as a result of a chemical reaction.
- **Chemical Equation**: a symbolic representation of a chemical reaction showing the reactants and products.
- **Stoichiometry**: the calculation of the quantities of reactants and products involved in a chemical reaction.

## States of Matter

- **Solid**: a state of matter characterized by a fixed shape and volume.
- **Liquid**: a state of matter characterized by a fixed volume but not a fixed shape.
- **Gas**: a state of matter characterized by neither a fixed shape nor a fixed volume.
- **Plasma**: a high-temperature physical state of matter in which atoms lose most of their electrons.

## Acids and Bases

- **Acid**: a substance that donates hydrogen ions (H+) to a solution.
- **Base**: a substance that accepts hydrogen ions (H+) or donates hydroxide ions (OH-) to a solution.
- **pH**: a measure of the acidity or basicity of a solution.
