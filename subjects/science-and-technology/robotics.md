## Overview
Robotics is the field of study dedicated to designing, building, and programming robots. Robots can be used for a variety of tasks, including manufacturing, assembly, exploration, and more.

## Robot Control
Robot control is the process of commanding a robot to perform a specific task. Here are some fundamental concepts in robot control:

- **Joint space:** A robot's joint space is the set of all possible joint configurations for the robot. Joint positions can be controlled to move the robot's end effector to a desired position.
- **End effector pose:** A robot's end effector pose is the position and orientation of the end effector in 3D space. End effector poses can be controlled to move the robot's end effector to a desired position and orientation.
- **Trajectory planning:** Trajectory planning is the process of generating a smooth path for a robot to follow from its current position to a desired position. Trajectory planning can take into account constraints such as joint limits and collision avoidance.
- **Inverse kinematics:** Inverse kinematics is the process of determining the joint positions required to achieve a desired end effector pose. Inverse kinematics can be used to control a robot's end effector position and orientation.

## Robot Perception
Robot perception is the process of a robot sensing and interpreting its environment. Here are some fundamental concepts in robot perception:

- **Sensors:** Sensors are used to measure physical quantities such as distance, force, and temperature. Examples of sensors used in robotics include cameras, lidar, and force/torque sensors.
- **Object recognition:** Object recognition is the process of identifying objects in a robot's environment. Object recognition can be used for tasks such as grasping and manipulation.
- **Localization:** Localization is the process of determining a robot's position and orientation in its environment. Localization can be used for tasks such as navigation and mapping.

## Robot Programming
Robot programming is the process of creating software to control a robot. Here are some fundamental concepts in robot programming:

- **Programming languages:** Programming languages such as Python and C++ are commonly used in robotics. These languages can be used to write software that controls a robot's behavior.
- **ROS:** ROS (Robot Operating System) is a framework for building robot software. ROS provides a set of tools and libraries for developing robot applications.
- **Simulation:** Simulation is the process of creating a virtual environment to test robot software. Simulation can be used to test robot behavior in a variety of scenarios.
