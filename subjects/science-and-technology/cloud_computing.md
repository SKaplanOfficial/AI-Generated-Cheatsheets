# Cloud Computing Cheatsheet

## Overview
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet. These services can include servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more. Here are some fundamental concepts in cloud computing:

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** IaaS provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Examples of IaaS providers include Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure.
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** PaaS provides a platform for developing, running, and managing applications over the internet. Examples of PaaS providers include Heroku and Google App Engine.
- **Software as a Service (SaaS):** SaaS provides software applications over the internet. Examples of SaaS providers include Salesforce and Microsoft Office 365.

## Cloud Architecture
Cloud architecture is the design of a cloud computing system. Here are some fundamental concepts in cloud architecture:

- **Virtualization:** Virtualization allows multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine. This enables efficient use of computing resources in the cloud.
- **Load balancing:** Load balancing distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers. This improves performance and reliability in the cloud.
- **Auto-scaling:** Auto-scaling automatically adjusts the number of computing resources based on demand. This enables efficient use of computing resources in the cloud.

## Cloud Storage
Cloud storage is the storage of data in the cloud. Here are some fundamental concepts in cloud storage:

- **Object storage:** Object storage is a storage architecture that manages data as objects rather than as files or blocks. Examples of object storage providers include Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage.
- **Block storage:** Block storage is a storage architecture that manages data as blocks. Examples of block storage providers include Amazon EBS and Google Cloud Persistent Disk.
- **File storage:** File storage is a storage architecture that manages data as files. Examples of file storage providers include Amazon EFS and Google Cloud Filestore.

## Cloud Security
Cloud security is the protection of data and resources in the cloud. Here are some fundamental concepts in cloud security:

- **Encryption:** Encryption is the process of encoding data to prevent unauthorized access. Encryption can be used to protect data in transit and at rest in the cloud.
- **Access control:** Access control is the process of managing user access to computing resources in the cloud. Access control can be used to prevent unauthorized access to data and resources.
- **Compliance:** Compliance refers to adherence to regulations and standards related to data protection and security. Compliance can be used to ensure that data is protected in the cloud.
