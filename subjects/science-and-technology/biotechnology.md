# Biotechnology Cheatsheet

## Overview
Biotechnology is the application of biological and engineering principles to develop new technologies and products. Here are some fundamental concepts in biotechnology:

- **Genetic engineering:** Genetic engineering is the process of modifying the genetic material of an organism. Genetic engineering can be used to produce new products or to modify the characteristics of an organism.
- **Bioprocessing:** Bioprocessing is the use of biological systems to produce products. Bioprocessing can be used to produce drugs, fuels, and other products.
- **Biomaterials:** Biomaterials are materials that are compatible with biological systems. Biomaterials can be used for medical implants, drug delivery, and other applications.

## Molecular Biology
Molecular biology is the study of biological molecules and their interactions. Here are some fundamental concepts in molecular biology:

- **DNA:** DNA is the genetic material that encodes the instructions for the development and function of living organisms. DNA can be manipulated using genetic engineering techniques.
- **Proteins:** Proteins are large molecules that perform a wide range of functions in living organisms. Proteins can be produced using bioprocessing techniques.
- **Enzymes:** Enzymes are proteins that catalyze biochemical reactions. Enzymes can be used in bioprocessing to produce products more efficiently.

## Biomedical Engineering
Biomedical engineering is the application of engineering principles to develop new medical technologies. Here are some fundamental concepts in biomedical engineering:

- **Medical imaging:** Medical imaging is the use of technology to produce images of the human body. Medical imaging can be used for diagnosis and treatment planning.
- **Drug delivery:** Drug delivery is the process of delivering drugs to specific locations in the body. Drug delivery can be used to treat diseases more effectively.
- **Tissue engineering:** Tissue engineering is the development of artificial tissues for medical applications. Tissue engineering can be used to replace damaged or diseased tissues.

## Bioprocessing
Bioprocessing is the use of biological systems to produce products. Here are some fundamental concepts in bioprocessing:

- **Fermentation:** Fermentation is the process of using microorganisms to produce products. Fermentation can be used to produce drugs, fuels, and other products.
- **Downstream processing:** Downstream processing is the purification and isolation of a product after it has been produced. Downstream processing can be used to purify drugs and other products.
- **Bioreactors:** Bioreactors are vessels used to grow and maintain microorganisms or cells for bioprocessing. Bioreactors can be used to produce large quantities of products.
