# Ecology Cheatsheet

## Overview

Ecology is the study of how organisms interact with each other and their environment. It is concerned with understanding the distribution, abundance, and diversity of organisms, as well as the biotic and abiotic factors that influence them.

## Ecological Concepts

- **Biodiversity**: The variety of life in a particular ecosystem or on Earth as a whole.
- **Ecosystem**: A community of organisms interacting with each other and their physical environment.
- **Habitat**: The physical environment where an organism lives.
- **Niche**: The role or function of an organism within its ecosystem.
- **Population**: A group of individuals of the same species that live in the same area.
- **Community**: All of the populations of different species that live and interact in a particular area.
- **Biome**: A large-scale ecosystem characterized by similar climate, vegetation, and animal life.

## Ecological Relationships

- **Competition**: When two or more organisms compete for the same resource, such as food, water, or shelter.
- **Predation**: When one organism (the predator) kills and eats another organism (the prey).
- **Symbiosis**: A close and long-term interaction between two different species.
    - **Mutualism**: Both species benefit from the interaction.
    - **Commensalism**: One species benefits from the interaction while the other is unaffected.
    - **Parasitism**: One species benefits from the interaction while the other is harmed.

## Ecological Processes

- **Photosynthesis**: The process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into organic matter (sugar) and oxygen.
- **Respiration**: The process by which organisms break down organic matter (sugar) to release energy for cellular processes and produce carbon dioxide and water as waste products.
- **Decomposition**: The process by which dead organisms and waste products are broken down into simpler compounds by decomposers, such as bacteria and fungi.
- **Nutrient Cycling**: The movement of nutrients, such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus, through ecosystems as they are taken up by organisms, released through waste and decomposition, and reused by other organisms.

## Ecological Applications

- **Conservation Biology**: The study of preserving and restoring biodiversity and ecosystems.
- **Restoration Ecology**: The practice of restoring degraded or destroyed ecosystems to their natural state.
- **Agroecology**: The study of applying ecological principles to agriculture to promote sustainable and resilient food systems.
- **Urban Ecology**: The study of the ecology of urban areas and the design of sustainable cities.
