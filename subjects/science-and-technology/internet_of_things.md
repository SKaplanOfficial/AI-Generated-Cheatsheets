# Internet of Things (IoT) Cheatsheet

## Overview
The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical devices, vehicles, buildings, and other objects that are embedded with sensors, software, and connectivity, enabling them to collect and exchange data. Here are some fundamental concepts in IoT:

- **Sensors:** Sensors are used to measure physical quantities such as temperature, pressure, and motion. Sensors can be used to collect data from the environment.
- **Connectivity:** Connectivity refers to the ability of devices to communicate with each other and with the internet. Connectivity can be used to transmit data between devices and to the cloud.
- **Data analytics:** Data analytics is the process of analyzing large amounts of data to extract insights and patterns. Data analytics can be used to make decisions based on IoT data.

## IoT Architecture
IoT architecture is the design of an IoT system. Here are some fundamental concepts in IoT architecture:

- **Device layer:** The device layer consists of the physical devices that collect and transmit data. Examples of devices in the device layer include sensors and actuators.
- **Gateway layer:** The gateway layer is responsible for collecting and processing data from the device layer. Gateways can be used to preprocess data before it is transmitted to the cloud.
- **Cloud layer:** The cloud layer is responsible for storing and analyzing data from the device layer. Cloud services can be used to process and analyze IoT data.

## IoT Communication
IoT communication is the exchange of data between devices. Here are some fundamental concepts in IoT communication:

- **Wireless communication:** Wireless communication is the use of wireless networks to transmit data between devices. Examples of wireless networks used in IoT include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Zigbee.
- **MQTT:** MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight messaging protocol used in IoT. MQTT can be used to transmit data between devices and between devices and the cloud.
- **REST APIs:** REST (Representational State Transfer) APIs can be used to expose IoT data to other applications. REST APIs can be used to make IoT data accessible to web and mobile applications.

## IoT Security
IoT security is the protection of IoT devices and data from unauthorized access. Here are some fundamental concepts in IoT security:

- **Device authentication:** Device authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a device. Device authentication can be used to prevent unauthorized access to IoT devices.
- **Data encryption:** Data encryption is the process of encoding data to prevent unauthorized access. Data encryption can be used to protect IoT data in transit and at rest.
- **Firewalls:** Firewalls can be used to protect IoT devices from unauthorized access. Firewalls can be used to block unauthorized network traffic to IoT devices.
