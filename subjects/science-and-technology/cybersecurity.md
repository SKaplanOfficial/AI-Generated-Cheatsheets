# Cybersecurity Cheatsheet

## Overview
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computer systems and networks from digital attacks, theft, and damage. Here are some fundamental concepts in cybersecurity:

- **Threats:** Threats are potential attacks or vulnerabilities that can be exploited by cybercriminals. Threats can include malware, phishing, and social engineering.
- **Security measures:** Security measures are steps taken to protect computer systems and networks from threats. Security measures can include firewalls, encryption, and multi-factor authentication.
- **Incident response:** Incident response is the process of responding to a cybersecurity incident. Incident response can include identifying the source of the incident, containing the incident, and restoring normal operations.

## Types of Threats
There are many types of threats that can be used to compromise computer systems and networks. Here are some fundamental types of threats:

- **Malware:** Malware is software designed to damage or disrupt computer systems. Examples of malware include viruses, worms, and Trojan horses.
- **Phishing:** Phishing is a type of social engineering attack where cybercriminals attempt to trick users into providing sensitive information such as passwords and credit card numbers.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** DoS attacks are designed to overwhelm computer systems with traffic, making them unavailable to users.
- **Ransomware:** Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a user's files and demands payment in exchange for the decryption key.

## Security Measures
There are many security measures that can be used to protect computer systems and networks from threats. Here are some fundamental security measures:

- **Firewalls:** Firewalls are software or hardware devices that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic. Firewalls can be used to block unauthorized traffic and prevent cyber attacks.
- **Encryption:** Encryption is the process of encoding data to prevent unauthorized access. Encryption can be used to protect sensitive data such as passwords and credit card numbers.
- **Multi-factor authentication:** Multi-factor authentication is the use of more than one method of authentication to verify a user's identity. Multi-factor authentication can include something the user knows (such as a password), something the user has (such as a security token), or something the user is (such as a fingerprint).
- **Patch management:** Patch management is the process of applying software updates to computer systems and networks. Patch management can be used to fix security vulnerabilities and prevent cyber attacks.

## Incident Response
Incident response is the process of responding to a cybersecurity incident. Here are some fundamental steps in incident response:

- **Identification:** Identification involves detecting and identifying the cybersecurity incident.
- **Containment:** Containment involves limiting the scope of the incident and preventing further damage or data loss.
- **Investigation:** Investigation involves analyzing the incident to determine the source and extent of the attack.
- **Remediation:** Remediation involves restoring normal operations and fixing any vulnerabilities that were exploited in the attack.
- **Reporting:** Reporting involves documenting the incident and reporting it to relevant parties such as law enforcement or regulatory agencies.
