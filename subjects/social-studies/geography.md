# Geography Cheatsheet

## Geographic Concepts
- **Latitude and Longitude**: Measured in degrees, latitude refers to the distance north or south of the equator, while longitude refers to the distance east or west of the prime meridian.
- **Topography**: The study of the shape and features of the Earth's surface, including mountains, valleys, and bodies of water.
- **Climate**: The long-term patterns of temperature, precipitation, and other weather conditions in a particular area.
- **Biomes**: Large regions of the world with similar climate, flora, and fauna, such as deserts, grasslands, and forests.
- **Ecosystems**: The interactions between living organisms and their physical environment, including biotic and abiotic factors.
- **Natural Hazards**: Natural phenomena that can cause harm to people, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and wildfires.

## Geographic Tools
- **Maps**: Two-dimensional representations of the Earth's surface, usually showing political boundaries, physical features, and other geographic information.
- **Globes**: Three-dimensional models of the Earth's surface that accurately represent the planet's shape and size.
- **Geographic Information Systems (GIS)**: Computer-based tools for capturing, storing, analyzing, and displaying geographic data.
- **Remote Sensing**: The use of satellites and other technologies to gather information about the Earth's surface from a distance.
- **Global Positioning System (GPS)**: A network of satellites that provide location and time information to GPS receivers.
- **Compass**: A tool that uses the Earth's magnetic field to determine direction.

## Geographic Techniques
- **Cartography**: The art and science of making maps.
- **Spatial Analysis**: The study of patterns and relationships between geographic features using statistical methods and other techniques.
- **Fieldwork**: The collection of geographic data through direct observation and measurement in the field.
- **Surveying**: The measurement and mapping of the Earth's surface, usually to determine property boundaries or to create topographic maps.
- **Data Collection**: The gathering of information about geographic features using various tools and methods.
- **Data Visualization**: The use of charts, graphs, and other visual tools to represent geographic data.

## Physical Geography
- **Geomorphology**: The study of the Earth's landforms and the processes that shape them.
- **Hydrology**: The study of water on the Earth's surface, including rivers, lakes, and groundwater.
- **Climatology**: The study of climate and its long-term patterns.
- **Biogeography**: The study of the distribution of plants and animals across the Earth's surface.
- **Pedology**: The study of soils and their properties.
- **Oceanography**: The study of the Earth's oceans and their physical and biological properties.

## Human Geography
- **Cultural Geography**: The study of the distribution of human cultures across the Earth's surface.
- **Economic Geography**: The study of the distribution of economic activity across the Earth's surface.
- **Political Geography**: The study of the distribution of political systems and their boundaries across the Earth's surface.
- **Population Geography**: The study of the distribution of human populations across the Earth's surface.
- **Urban Geography**: The study of cities and the processes that shape them.
- **Tourism Geography**: The study of the geographic patterns and impacts of tourism.
