# Photography Cheatsheet

## Camera Settings
- Aperture: controls depth of field
- Shutter speed: controls motion blur
- ISO: controls sensor sensitivity

## Exposure Triangle
- Aperture, shutter speed, and ISO work together to create proper exposure
- Changing one setting affects the others
- Balancing the three creates a desired exposure

## Focusing
- Manual focus: manually adjust focus ring on lens
- Auto focus: camera automatically adjusts focus

## Composition
- Rule of thirds: divide frame into thirds and place subject on intersection points
- Leading lines: use lines to guide viewer's eye to subject
- Symmetry: create balance by placing subject in center of frame
- Framing: use elements in scene to frame subject

## Lighting
- Natural light: use available light from sun or other sources
- Artificial light: use flash or other lighting equipment
- Direction: determine direction of light to create desired mood or effect

## Post-Processing
- Raw files: unprocessed image files that allow for more editing flexibility
- Editing software: use software such as Adobe Lightroom or Photoshop to adjust exposure, color, and other settings
- Exporting: save edited image as JPEG or other file format for sharing or printing
