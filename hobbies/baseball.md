# Baseball Cheatsheet

## Basics
- **Field of Play:** Diamond with four bases, laid out in a square shape. 
- **Objective:** Score more runs than the opposing team.
- **Equipment:** Bat, ball, glove, helmet, cleats.
- **Innings:** Game is played in nine innings, with each team playing both offense and defense in each inning.

## Offense
- **Batter:** Player who is currently at bat.
- **Pitcher:** Player who throws the ball to the batter.
- **Strike Zone:** Area over home plate where pitches thrown within it are considered strikes. 
- **Hitting:** Batter tries to hit the ball thrown by the pitcher and reach a base.
- **Bases:** The four bases are first base, second base, third base, and home plate. A player scores a run when they cross home plate after touching all three bases in order.
- **Outs:** The team on defense is trying to get three outs per inning. An out is declared when a batter swings and misses three times, hits the ball in the air and it is caught before it lands, or is tagged with the ball before reaching a base.
- **Walk:** If the pitcher throws four pitches outside of the strike zone, the batter is awarded first base without swinging the bat.

## Defense
- **Fielding:** Team on defense tries to prevent the other team from scoring.
- **Pitcher:** Throws the ball to the batter.
- **Catcher:** Stands behind the batter to catch pitches thrown by the pitcher.
- **Infielders:** Players who play defense in the infield.
- **Outfielders:** Players who play defense in the outfield.
- **Double Play:** Two outs in a single play. Commonly, when a ground ball is hit to an infielder, they throw to second base to get the runner out, then to first base to get the batter out.
- **Triple Play:** Three outs in a single play. 

## Scoring
- **Runs:** Scored by crossing home plate after touching all three bases in order. A home run is when the batter hits the ball out of the field of play and crosses home plate, scoring a run.
- **Earned Runs:** Runs scored off of the pitcher, that would have scored even if the defense had made no errors.
- **RBIs:** Runs batted in. Awarded to the batter who hits a run-scoring play.
- **Errors:** Mistakes made by a player on defense that allow a batter or runner to reach base or score. 

## Rules and Regulations
- **Infield Fly Rule:** A rule designed to prevent a defensive player from dropping a pop-up on purpose to turn a double or triple play. When there are runners on first and second or first, second, and third bases with less than two outs, an infield fly is called if a fly ball is hit that can be caught by an infielder with ordinary effort.
- **Designated Hitter Rule:** A rule used in the American League, where a team can designate a player to hit for the pitcher, without needing to play in the field.
- **Balk:** An illegal pitch. The pitcher makes a movement with the ball that simulates a pitch, but doesn't deliver the ball to the plate.
