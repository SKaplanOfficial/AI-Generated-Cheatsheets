## Basic Tools
* Clay
* Pottery Wheel or Hand-building tools
* Water
* Sponge
* Clay cutting tools
* Kiln
* Glaze and brushes (optional)

## Basic Steps
1. Prepare the clay by kneading it and removing air pockets
2. Center the clay on the pottery wheel
3. Open up the clay to form the base
4. Pull the clay up and shape it to create the walls of the vessel
5. Smooth the surface of the pot with a sponge
6. Use clay cutting tools to trim excess clay and refine the shape
7. Allow the pottery to dry completely
8. Fire the pottery in a kiln to harden it
9. Optional: Apply glaze to the pottery and fire it again in the kiln

## Terminology
* Wedging: The process of kneading the clay to remove air pockets and improve workability
* Centering: The process of positioning the clay on the pottery wheel to create a stable base for forming the pottery
* Throwing: The process of shaping the clay on the pottery wheel
* Coiling: The process of creating pottery by building up the walls with coils of clay, rather than using a pottery wheel
* Glaze: A coating of glass that is applied to the surface of the pottery to create a decorative finish and protect the surface
* Bisque firing: The initial firing of the pottery to harden it and prepare it for glazing
* Glaze firing: The second firing of the pottery after glaze has been applied, which melts the glaze and creates a finished surface

## Tips and Tricks
* Keep the clay and your hands moist to prevent cracking
* Use a steady, gentle pressure when forming the pottery
* Avoid making the walls too thin, as they may collapse during the firing process
* Experiment with different shapes, textures, and colors to create unique pieces
* Be patient and take your time - pottery making requires practice and skill development over time
