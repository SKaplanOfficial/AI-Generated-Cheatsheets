# Hockey Cheatsheet

## Basic Rules

- Two teams of six players (five skaters and one goalie) compete to score goals.
- The game is divided into three periods, each 20 minutes long.
- The team with the most goals at the end of the game wins.
- A player can use their stick to hit the puck, but body checking is allowed only in certain situations.
- Penalties can be called for a variety of infractions, such as tripping, slashing, and high-sticking.

## Positions

- **Forward:** Typically the team's primary offensive players, forwards play in the opponent's end of the rink and aim to score goals.
- **Defense:** Positioned in their own end of the rink, defensemen aim to prevent the opposing team from scoring.
- **Goalie:** The last line of defense, the goalie's main responsibility is to stop the puck from entering the net.

## Skills

- **Skating:** Good skaters are fast and agile, and can quickly change directions.
- **Stickhandling:** A player's ability to control the puck with their stick is crucial for maintaining possession and creating scoring opportunities.
- **Shooting:** A powerful and accurate shot is key to scoring goals.
- **Passing:** Good passers can quickly move the puck around the rink, creating opportunities for their team.

## Equipment

- **Skates:** Ice hockey skates are designed to be rigid and provide support and control on the ice.
- **Stick:** Players use sticks to handle the puck and shoot.
- **Protective gear:** Helmets, gloves, shin guards, elbow pads, and shoulder pads are all important for protecting players from injury.
- **Goalie equipment:** Goalies wear special equipment, including a mask, chest protector, leg pads, and a glove/blocker combination.

## Strategy

- **Forechecking:** When the opposing team has the puck, players can use aggressive forechecking to force turnovers and create scoring opportunities.
- **Backchecking:** When the other team is on the attack, players must quickly get back to their own end of the rink to prevent goals.
- **Power play:** When a player on the opposing team is in the penalty box, the other team has a man advantage and can be more aggressive on offense.
- **Penalty kill:** When one of their own players is in the penalty box, teams must play with one fewer player and focus on defense.
