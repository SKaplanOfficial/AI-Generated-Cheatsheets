# Dutch Cheatsheet

## Overview
Dutch is a West Germanic language spoken by over 23 million people as a first language in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Suriname, and as a second language in many other countries.

## Alphabet
The Dutch alphabet consists of 26 letters, including the following additional letters:
- `é`, `ë`, `ï`, `ö`, `ü`, and `é` with acute accents (`é` is also used in loanwords)
- `ij` and `y` (both considered separate letters)
- `ch`, `ng`, and `ij` (considered digraphs)

## Pronunciation
- `g` is pronounced as a guttural sound similar to the "ch" in Scottish "loch".
- `j` is pronounced as the "y" in "yes".
- `ui` is pronounced as the "ui" in "huis" (house).
- `ij` is pronounced as a diphthong similar to the "ei" in "rein" (pure).
- `eu` is pronounced as the "oi" in "boil".
- `sch` is pronounced as the "sk" in "school".
- `ch` is pronounced as the "k" in "kilo" at the beginning of a word, and as the guttural "ch" sound elsewhere.
- `ng` is pronounced as the "ng" in "sing".

## Grammar
- Dutch uses the Latin alphabet and is written from left to right.
- Nouns have gender (masculine, feminine, or neuter) and can be either singular or plural.
- Verbs are inflected for tense, aspect, and mood.
- Word order in Dutch sentences is typically subject-verb-object.
